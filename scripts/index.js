var turkeyLegsConsumed = 3;
// 1. Prefix your variables the first time you use them.
// 2. Use camelCase!
// 3. Terminate each line with `;`

// `var` was the original way to declare variables.
// `let` is better because:
// It gives you more control. (You can limit its use to a specific if/else or a specific loop.)
let turkeysCooked = 2;

// `const` is like `let`, but:
// - You must assign it when you declare it.
// - You can never reassign it.
const numberOfTurkeysICanEat = 1;

// How to use these keywords:
// 1. By default, create your variables using `const`
// 2. If you find out that you need to reassign it, change it to `let`.

// print("Hello World!")
console.log("Hello World!");

// print(turkeysCooked)
console.log(turkeysCooked);
